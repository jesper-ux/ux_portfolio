                            <p>I started with creating a flow chart over the Gallery Wall Inspiration rooms in order to
                                get an idea of how the current flow and tasks are set up on the website in order for a
                                user to fulfill a complete purchase. In the flow chart, I defined that the Gallery Wall
                                Inspiration Rooms can be divided into 5 different tasks:

                            <ol>
                                <li>Finding the Gallery Wall rooms</li>
                                <li>Selecting a Gallery Wall</li>
                                <li>Customizing the Gallery Wall</li>
                                <li>Add it to the shopping bag</li>
                                <li>Completing the purchase in checkout.</li>
                            </ol>

                            I then interviewed various stakeholders and a representative from their Customer Support
                            team to gather important insights. In order to
                            better understand their users problems, needs and wishes I conducted one user interview and
                            a user test. I also got to take part of 5 pre-recorded user tests that had been conducted
                            before I started my internship which were analyzed together with my own user tests and
                            interviews.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I noted down quotes and grouped them thematically in order to pin point important
                                insights from the interviews and user tests which was put together as an Empathy Map
                                Canvas.

                                When I was more aware of the problems, needs and wishes from their users, I also set up
                                a cognitive walkthrough where I segmented all the gain and the pain points that I
                                personally could identify for each task, with the users needs in mind.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-3">
                                I then created a User Story Map where I segmented all the pain points and gain points I
                                had identified from my research into the different tasks.

                                As I was going to present my research for various stakeholders at the company, I also
                                created a User Story Journey in order to better communicate the gain and the pain points
                                that were identified from my research.

                                When the User Journey had been completed, I invited all the stakeholders to a meeting
                                where I presented the findings I had gathered in my research, and finally a summary of
                                the major pain points which should be the focus of a new design iteration of the Gallery
                                Wall Inspiration Rooms.

                                Since their system currently doesn’t bundle items within a gallery wall in the checkout,
                                it is not possible to track them or benchmark the conversion rates for them, so I
                                determined that the bundle feature for sure was the most important part of the MVP so
                                they could start benchmarking the sales numbers. Currently there is no way of tracking
                                the sales of the gallery walls.

                                in order to find inspiration for designs that could solve the major pain points. I
                                collected all the benchmarks I could find in a Miro board, and did a Crazy 8 in order to
                                ideate various design suggestions that could be integrated together with their current
                                design.
